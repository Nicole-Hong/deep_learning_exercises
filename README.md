# deep_learning_programs

The objective of this project is to build the use cases of various deep learning models by creating programs for the real life applications and model deployment. The following deep learning models were studied and used for this project:
* CNN
* RNN
* GRU
* LSTM - Time Series
* LSTM - NLP
* BERT - NLP
* GAN - Computer Vision

## How to use this repository

This repository has the following main directories:

* __data:__ Keras datasets such as MNIST and Fashion MNIST
* __figures:__ visualizations generated from running models
* __images:__ diagrams created for summary of processes and components
* __src:__ code for various deep learning models


### Workflow Overview (WIP)

* Create the scenarios / use cases for the real-life applications
* Design the layout of models and applications
* Research the platforms for the model deployment
* Develop the base models
* Train / Test & Feature extraction
* Performance measure
* Deploy the models


### System Requirements

This project has been developed using Python, Jupyter Notebook and Google CoLab, which are run on a Windows system. For Deep Learning and Transformer Models, GPU / TPU in Google CoLab were required.
