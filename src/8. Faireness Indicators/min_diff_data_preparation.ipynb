    "##Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing MinDiff, you will need to make complex decisions as you choose and shape your input before passing it on to the model. These decisions will largely determine the behavior of MinDiff within your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will cover the technical aspects of this process, but will not discuss how to evaluate a model for fairness, or how to identify particular slices and metrics for evaluation. Please see the [Fairness Indicators guidance](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/fairness_indicators/guide/guidance) for details on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate MinDiff, this guide uses the [UCI income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income). The model task is to predict whether an individual has an income exceeding $50k, based on various personal attributes. This guide assumes there is a problematic gap in the FNR (false negative rate) between `\"Male\"` and `\"Female\"` slices and the model owner (you) has decided to apply MinDiff to address the issue. For more information on the scenarios in which one might choose to apply MinDiff, see the [requirements page](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/model_remediation/min_diff/guide/requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We recognize the limitations of the categories used in the original dataset, and acknowledge that these terms do not encompass the full range of vocabulary used in describing gender. Further, we acknowledge that this task doesnâ€™t represent a real-world use case, and is used only to demonstrate the technical details of the MinDiff library.\n",
    "\n",
    "MinDiff works by penalizing the difference in distribution scores between examples in two sets of data. This guide will demonstrate how to choose and construct these additional MinDiff sets as well as how to package everything together so that it can be passed to a model for training.\n"
